# Carleton-Web-Dev
Repository that contains the various projects and assignments for my Directed Studies on Web Development at Carleton University.

## Requirements

`node@Latest LTS`

## Run the application locally

To run the application locally, you have to first make sure to install all dependencies by running `npm install`.

With that done, run `npm run start` to start the local server and navigate to `localhost:3000` to view it.

The application will automatically reload when code changes happen, so you can keep it running.

## Deploy the application to Github

To run the application locally, you have to first make sure to install all dependencies by running `npm install`. Also, make sure you have write access to the repo. The hosted page updates automatically when a PR is merged to master, so you should never have to deploy manually.

Run `npm run deploy` to deploy the application to Github.

Github caches Github Pages websites, and it may take a few minutes to update.
