This presentation was intended to compare all three techs. 

Through the semester, it became clear such a comparison was not a good way to think about
 those technologies.

In my opinion **all three techs are complementary and will become the new frontend stack.**

When we were planning the directed studies, the presentation was expected to be about comparing all three
 technologies and thinking about their pros and cons for building UIs. 

As we researched and studied the techs more, it became clear such a comparison was not a good way to think about
 those technologies.

- React, and the Virtual DOM, are best suited to create reactive single page applications.

- Web Component are best suited to create portable elements that can be reused regardless of the codebase.

- Web Assembly is best suited for running complex computations and existing codebase with high speed and security. 

Learning all three technologies is a plus for any budding frontend developer.

- React, and the Virtual DOM, are best suited to create reactive single page applications.

- Web Component are best suited to create portable elements that can be reused regardless of the codebase. They
 complement the Virtual DOM by offering ways to create styled elements with scoped CSS, and the VDOM complements them
 by offering a way to create their content.

- Web Assembly is best suited for running complex computations and existing codebase with high speed and security. 

Learning all three technologies may become mandatory as web development evolves and other languages start to be used
 on the frontend.

## Conclusion

In this presentation, we quickly explored some technologies used in frontend development, and their use cases.

.text-left[
- The DOM and how JavaScript can be used to make pages more dynamic
- The Virtual DOM and how it changed our conception of UIs.
- Web components as a way to create portable native components.
- WASM as a technology for running other languages in the browser and creating UIs in those languages
- Comparing all three techs and their uses cases.
